# PCB-Business-Card

Brainstorming:

* Design style: Sleek, minimalistic
* * Color Scheme: Green and Silver (Lead Free HASL is still affordable, ENIG is insane, special order fees are also insane for Black silkscreen)
* * Size: 0.8mm (Still a reasonable cost)
* * Design: Could use untented vias if a golden color is wanted
* Function: USB drive that has resume, links to website, playable demos
* * Memory capacity: 32GB since it's enough for basic use but not too expensive
* Info on card: Name, email, phone number
